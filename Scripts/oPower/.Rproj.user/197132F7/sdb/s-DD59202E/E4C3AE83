Helping us understand what amounts of energy people use, how they use it, and why they use it can lead us to new insights. \n\\\\\\\\\nSome of these insights could enable us to target customers to change their usage habits, or inform us on the type of products users may require. It may also help us during the planning stage of electricity generation.\\\\\n\nFirstly I downloaded data from the following website:\\\\\nhttp://en.openei.org/datasets/dataset/commercial-and-residential-hourly-load-profiles-for-all-tmy3-locations-in-the-united-states.\n\nThis contains data from multiple buildings, recorded every hour for the entire year of 2004.\n\n\\section{Analysis}\n\\subsection{Data Manipulation}\n\n<<echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE>>=\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(\"plyr\")\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(\"lubridate\")\nlibrary(pracma)\nlibrary(\"reshape\")\nlibrary(\"reshape2\")\n@\n\nThe first step was an introductory manipulation of the data, to gain rapid insights. Initially, information on the days, months, and hours were required by converting the date to a format easily understandable by \n\n<<results='hide',echo=FALSE>>=\n\n\n@\n\n\n\\end{document}",
